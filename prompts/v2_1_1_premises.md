# Codebook 2.1.1 Pass A: premise extraction

Pass A extracts the premises of an entrepreneurial theory from a single pitch transcript. Strategic domains and causal links are not coded in this pass. Pass B (composition tagging) and Pass C (domain grouping) are applied subsequently to the finalized premise list.

> **Instrument note.** Sections 1 to 5 constitute the coding instrument. Sections 6 and 7 are machine only (output format and call template). Any revision to sections 1 to 5 constitutes a new codebook version; agreement statistics computed under a prior version do not carry forward.
>
> Sections 1 to 3 define the constructs and are read once during coder training. **Section 4 is the coding protocol for each transcript.** Section 5 provides three worked examples.


## 1. Coder role

> You are a trained research coder applying a fixed codebook to a single pitch transcript. Your task is descriptive measurement, not evaluation: do not assess whether the pitch is persuasive, investable, or likely to succeed, and do not infer its outcome. Code only what the transcript states or clearly implies. Where the text does not support a coding decision, omit the unit rather than inferring structure.


## 2. Blind-coding requirement

The coding input consists of transcript text and an anonymous case identifier. It must not include venture name, founder name, event, year, funding history, selection outcome, or other outcome-relevant metadata.

> **Instruction to the model:** The transcript may contain a company or product name. If you recognize the venture, disregard all external knowledge of it, including subsequent funding, growth, acquisition, failure, or competitive performance. Code only what this transcript claims. Do not reference external knowledge in your output.


## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Premises within entrepreneurial theory

Entrepreneurial theories comprise three elements: (1) **premises** about conditions that drive value creation, (2) **causal links** connecting premises to one another and to value, and (3) **strategic domains** grouping premises that can be learned and revised together. This codebook codes the first element only.

### 3.2 Premise

A **premise** is an explicit or clearly implied claim about a condition the entrepreneur treats as necessary for the theory to create value. The claim must be specific enough that, in principle, it could be shown to be wrong.

Breadth is measured as the count of premises. The main coding decision in this pass is therefore **how to split the transcript into premises**: where one premise ends and the next begins.


## 4. Coding protocol

This pass extracts premises only. Composition tagging and domain grouping are deferred to later passes.

### 4.1 Procedure

Apply the following steps in order.

1. **Initial read.** Read the transcript once without coding.

2. **Identify claims.** Mark each claim the entrepreneur presents as necessary for the venture's theory of value to hold. Claims may take the form of design choices, capabilities, or assumptions about customers, channels, technology, or operations. Code each claim at the scope at which the entrepreneur asserts it: do not subdivide a claim the entrepreneur did not separate, and do not merge claims the entrepreneur kept distinct. When the entrepreneur bundles several items into one assertion (e.g., "parents face five pain points"), treat the whole assertion as one claim.

3. **Apply exclusions.** Do not code the following as premises:

   - Financing ask, valuation, equity offered, or capital already raised.
   - Greetings, closings, thanks, and appeals to the audience.
   - Speech by anyone other than the pitching entrepreneur(s), and any Q&A content.
   - Product or company name stated without an associated condition.
   - Biographical credentials, unless the theory itself would have to change if the credential were untrue, rather than merely looking weaker.
   - Traction or press metrics offered as evidence of past performance. When the entrepreneur presents the underlying mechanism as a continuing condition for value, code the mechanism, not the metric.
   - Industry vision statements (e.g., *"the future of data is a writable future"*). See section 4.3.

4. **State what would need to change.** For each remaining claim, write briefly what the entrepreneur would need to change if the claim turned out to be wrong (e.g., *reformulate the product*, *secure alternative supply*, *rebuild the tracking module*). If nothing would need to change, the claim is not a condition the venture depends on; exclude it.

   Write the change as **work the venture would have to carry out**, at the scale at which it would actually carry it out — the examples above are the intended scale. A change that the venture would complete *in the course of* carrying out another change you have already written is not a separate change: adding one more screen, field, integration, or notification inside a capability already listed is part of building that capability, not work of its own. Where the entrepreneur states or shows that an item was built separately, or could be dropped while the rest stood, it is work of its own.

5. **Decide how many premises.** Claims that would require the same change belong to **one premise**. Claims that would require different changes belong to **separate premises**.

6. **When the split is still unclear, record separate premises.** Reach this step only after writing the changes in step 4 and comparing them in step 5; it settles cases those steps leave open, and is not an alternative to performing them. Name the undecided pair and both changes you wrote in `notes`. Do not default to merging.

7. **Record each premise.** State each premise as one declarative sentence in the entrepreneur's terms, normalized only for grammar. Attach an **evidence span**: a contiguous substring copied verbatim from the transcript. Spacing and capitalization may differ from the premise text; the words must match. Do not paraphrase or quote text absent from the transcript. Where the meaning is clear despite an obvious transcription error, correct the premise text only; the evidence span retains the transcript as written. If the transcript is truncated, code only what is present. When multiple co-founders present, pool their claims without duplicating premises stated by more than one speaker.

**No target premise count.** Breadth is computed downstream and is not a coding input. Neither narrow nor broad theories are preferred; do not add, omit, or merge premises to adjust list length.

### 4.2 Worked examples: one premise or several

The following cases apply steps 4 and 5 to recurring transcript patterns. They illustrate the protocol; they do not add rules. When a case is not listed, apply steps 4 and 5 directly.

**One premise** (one change would address all claims):

- Restatement or near-synonyms: *"it's delicious, it tastes great, people love the flavor."*
- Quantitative detail modifying a claim: *"24 inches tall, holds 26 ounces."*
- A mechanism presented as indivisible: *"a single 30-second phone scan replaces in-person measurement."*
- Performance attributes of one process: *"faster, cheaper, uses less water, emits less CO2."*
- Enumerated applications of one capability: *"First, active warning. Two, usable for logistics. Three, your building has a Carfax,"* describing one sensor network.
- Features that follow from a single integration, such as BYOD activation, presence, and transcription from one switch platform.
- Price and channel structure for the same offering.
- Patents attached to a mechanism already claimed.
- A problem set presented as one unmet need: *"parents face five major pain points."*
- Steps of a live demonstration that show one capability in use: opening a card, seeing nearby showtimes, following a link into another app, receiving a notification — one integrated product being shown from several angles.

**Several premises** (each claim requires its own change):

- Coordinated claims about different conditions: *"combines seaweed and mushrooms, and we source kelp from regenerative ocean farms."*
- Capabilities each performing a distinct function: communication, report cards, GPS tracking, fee payment, delivery.
- Intellectual property licensed or sold as a separate line of business.
- A product use presented as independently offered.
- Partner or reseller economics that could fail while the stated price point remained.
- Demonstrated steps the entrepreneur presents as built or sold separately, such as a module offered on its own or one the pitch says could be dropped while the rest stood.

Lists often raise this question and appear on both sides above. Apply the same test: if one change would address every item, the list is one premise; if each item requires its own change, each is a separate premise. In the School Bridge pitch, five pain points form one premise (change: re-target the problem set); five product capabilities form five premises (each requires its own build or change).

Product demonstrations raise it in the same way and are settled the same way, using the scale of change set in step 4: a walkthrough that moves through one product does not become several premises because it has several moments, and a walkthrough does not become one premise because it was shown in one sitting. Ask what work each shown step would be, and whether that work would be done as part of building a step already recorded.

### 4.3 Value criterion

Record **one value criterion** in the `value` field: the beneficiary and/or the outcome the market is claimed to receive. When the entrepreneur identifies a priority benefit, code that benefit. Financing is never a value criterion.

Omit `value` only when the transcript neither states nor clearly implies a value criterion, as when a pitch is truncated before value is asserted. Do not infer a value criterion.

The value criterion is not an independent variable in the analysis. It anchors what counts as "necessary for the theory to create value" and permits audit of premise coding decisions.


## 5. Worked examples

Three **verbatim hold-out transcripts** from the Startup Battlefield corpus, coded according to section 4. The same transcripts and frozen premise lists appear in Pass B and Pass C §5. These cases are reserved for training and agreement calibration and are **excluded from the confirmatory analysis sample** (see `prompts/registry.md` and `data/corpora/startup_battlefield/samples/calibration_holdouts.csv`).

### 5.1 ByteKnight (`pilot-65`)

**Transcript:** "Hi, everyone. Do you ever think where all the data that goes to the cloud gets processed? It usually ends up in massive, energy-guzzling data centers that are often designed to maximize profits without much regard for the environment. Today, these silicon hubs are facing growing pressure, giving the skyrocketing demand for media and AI processing, and also giving the rising costs of microchips connected to the semiconductor shortage. Meanwhile, 12 billion devices sit idly in our pockets or on our desks. Picture this, a worldwide grid powered by everyone's computers or smartphones, supporting fast, distributed computations and providing a sustainable, equitable way of computing. My name is Fabio, and two years ago I dreamt of this reality. The dream is called ByteKnight. We are a software that harnesses the collective strength of everyday devices to tackle intensive tasks like video encoding, generative AI, and 3D rendering. There's an incentive for those who join our network. We share 70% of the revenue, and we allow you to earn up to $150 per month for each device that you provide. Plus, the customers can reap the benefits of cost-effective, speedy computing and accelerate their workflows up to 30 times relative to the cloud. But ByteKnight isn't just about smart tech. We're a green initiative, breathing new life into older devices and reducing substantial energy wastage relative to traditional data centers. The future is looking bright for us. With a beta in action, a growing wait list, and an exciting partnership with Storj, we're set to revolutionize the world of computing, starting from video encoding and generative AI. Join us in this amazing journey. You can find us at booth A7 or on our website www.byteknight.com. Thank you."

**Premises:**

| Id | Premise | Evidence span |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Cloud data centers are energy-intensive and face rising demand and cost pressure | "massive, energy-guzzling data centers that are often designed to maximize profits without much regard for the environment" |
| P2 | Billions of idle consumer devices represent unused compute capacity | "12 billion devices sit idly in our pockets or on our desks" |
| P3 | Distributed software can harness everyday devices for intensive compute workloads | "harnesses the collective strength of everyday devices to tackle intensive tasks like video encoding, generative AI, and 3D rendering" |
| P4 | Revenue sharing can incentivize device owners to join the network | "We share 70% of the revenue, and we allow you to earn up to $150 per month for each device that you provide" |
| P5 | Distributed compute can be faster and cheaper than traditional cloud for customers | "accelerate their workflows up to 30 times relative to the cloud" |
| P6 | Reusing idle devices reduces energy waste versus data centers | "reducing substantial energy wastage relative to traditional data centers" |

**Value criterion:** Computing becomes sustainable and equitable through a distributed device grid. Evidence span: "sustainable, equitable way of computing."

**Notes:** Semiconductor shortage and AI demand illustrate P1; they are not separate premises. Beta status, wait list, and Storj partnership are excluded as traction under step 3.

### 5.2 Pi Charging (`pilot-620`)

**Transcript excerpt:** "Instead, we built Pi around a safe magnetic charging standard. But until today, magnetic charging was very limited. You had to put a device down perfectly parallel to the receiver to get any power. But thanks to our incredible team and Leeshan's breakthrough, our patented platform can power multiple devices at any angle. It's safe, it's affordable, and it's FCC compliant. Our business model has two parts. First, we will sell Pi directly to consumers. We have over 50% gross margins and anticipate a very high lifetime value per customer. If you like Pi in your kitchen, you're going to want one in the living room, the bedroom, and in the office and enterprise. Second, we are opening the Pi platform for use by existing consumer electronics OEMs."

**Premises:**

| Id | Premise | Evidence span |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Magnetic-field charging can power multiple devices at any angle | "patented platform can power multiple devices at any angle" |
| P2 | A patent protects the wireless-power approach | "our patented platform" |
| P3 | The product meets FCC safety requirements for consumer use | "It's safe, it's affordable, and it's FCC compliant" |
| P4 | Direct-to-consumer sales can sustain viable unit economics | "over 50% gross margins" |
| P5 | Multi-room adoption extends revenue per customer | "want one in the living room, the bedroom, and in the office and enterprise" |
| P6 | OEM licensing extends the platform to device manufacturers | "opening the Pi platform for use by existing consumer electronics OEMs" |

**Value criterion:** Consumers get safe, affordable contactless charging without charging pads. Evidence span: "It's safe, it's affordable, and it's FCC compliant."

**Notes:** Reservation counts, press coverage, and investor names elsewhere in the full pitch are excluded as traction. Patent protection and FCC compliance are separate premises because each would require a different change if wrong.

### 5.3 Akowe (`pilot-11`)

**Transcript:** "Good morning, everyone. My name is Ayodeji. I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. Do you know that in some parts of the world, you can actually order a diploma for just 10 bucks? Absolutely. Fake certificates, fake credentials are a huge problem. And Akowe is a digital issuance platform and verification of academic records using blockchain technology. What we've built is a solution for tertiary institutions to transition from manual credential processes to digital processes for issuance of credentials on the blockchain. We've also built out a verification platform that allows employers, embassies, HR firms, anybody who needs to verify academic records to be able to verify academic records via our platform. And finally, we have a mobile app for you, you, you, and you to be able to carry your credentials, academic credentials, with you anywhere in a safe and verifiable manner. Akowe launched late 2020, and we have about 30 corporate customers who use our system for issuing verifiable digital certificates. We also have APIs. People can connect to our system to issue credentials from their systems. And we are also actively fundraising. We're raising pre-seed round, 500k. And we're just over there at M4. If you want to see a demo of how it works, we're happy to show you how it works. Thank you very much."

**Premises:**

| Id | Premise | Evidence span |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Fake academic credentials are a widespread problem | "Fake certificates, fake credentials are a huge problem" |
| P2 | Institutions can issue digital credentials on blockchain | "transition from manual credential processes to digital processes for issuance of credentials on the blockchain" |
| P3 | Employers and other third parties can verify records through the platform | "verification platform that allows employers, embassies, HR firms, anybody who needs to verify academic records" |
| P4 | Holders can carry verifiable credentials in a mobile app | "carry your credentials, academic credentials, with you anywhere in a safe and verifiable manner" |

**Value criterion:** Academic credentials are issued and carried safely and verifiably. Evidence span: "safe and verifiable manner."

**Notes:** API issuance extends the institutional channel and is not a separate premise. Corporate customer count, fundraising, booth location, and demo offer are excluded under step 3.

- ids unique; `P*` premises, `V*` value
- every `evidence_span` verifies as a verbatim transcript substring
- **provenance required:** `meta.model_id` (non-empty string) and `meta.temperature_controlled` (boolean). `meta.temperature` carries a number only when sampling was actually pinned; when the extraction ran through a harness that does not expose the parameter, set `temperature_controlled: false` and `temperature: null` rather than recording an intended value as though it had been enforced. Record `model_provider`, `extraction_run`, and `extracted_at` whenever available.
